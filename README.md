# Description
This set of `R` scripts was designed to analyze the space of Optimal Solutions of the Correlation Clustering Problem.
Recently, we figured out that many unweighted signed networks may have multiple optimal solutions (i.e. partitions) for the Correlation Clustering Problem.
Our motivation is to explore this optimal multiplicity in many ways. This work is the first step to accomplish this task, and we will keep exploring more aspects in the near future.


# Data
Our tool is applied to a set of signed networks generated thanks to our [signed graph generator](https://github.com/CompNet/SignedBenchmark). The details about the generator are explained [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/pdggvqbsmrch). You may consider downloading our generated signed graphs, which are in the folder `Input Signed Networks.tar.gz` on [FigShare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.8233340). The advantage of dowloading our data is that we also provide you with the optimal solutions for each signed network (in the folder `All Partitions Results.tar.gz` on [FigShare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.8233340).
To show explicitly the folder structure used in the signed graph generation and for a quick test, we have already put some generated networks in `in/random-networks` and *some* corresponding optimal partitions in `out/partitions`. 


# Organization
Here are the folders composing the project:
* Folder `src`: contains the source code (R scripts).
* Folder `in`: contains the generated signed networks. 
* Folder `lib`: contains executable files related to the used external partitioning methods.
  * Folder `ExCC`: Executable file of the method `ExCC` whose the name will be `cplex-partition.jar`. See the *Installation* section for more details.
* Folder `out`: contains the folders and files produced by our scripts. See the *Use* section for more details.

3. Install [`IBM CPlex`](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp/entry/CPLEX_Is_Free_For_Students?lang=en). Tested with the version 12.8. Set correctly the variable `CPLEX.BIN.PATH` in `define-algos.R` (e.g. `/opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio128/cplex/bin/x86-64_linux/`).
   * For ubuntu, type the following command:
     * `sudo ./cplex_studio12.8.8.linux-x86-64.bin` 
       * The default installation location for education version is: `/opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio128`.

4. Download the project of `ExCC` from [github](https://github.com/arinik9/ExCC). First, configure and then compile it. To test it, you can run the file `run.sh`.If everything works (i.e. if a file `ExCC-result.txt` created in the output folder), move the exectuable file `cplex-partition.jar`, which is in `exe`, into the folder `lib/ExCC` in this project.
5. Download the signed networks on [`figshare`](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.8233340) or generate your own signed networks bases on our [signed graph generator](https://github.com/CompNet/SignedBenchmark).


# Use
1. Set correctly the variables `CPLEX.BIN.PATH`.
2. Open the `R` console.
3. Set the current directory as the working directory, using `setwd("<my directory>")`.
4. Run the main script `src/main.R`.


The script will produce the following subfolders in the folder `out`:
* `partitions`: Folder containing all obtained partitions. Note that we prefer to use the term *module* in the same sense of *cluster* in this level in order to distinguish it from the term *cluster* used in k-medoids clustering analysis.
  * `n=<GRAPH_SIZE>_l0=<NB_INIT_MODULES>_dens=<DENSITY>`: A subfolder for specific values of graph size, number of initial modules in the network and density.
    * `propMispl=<PROP_MISPL>`: A subfolder for a specific value of proportion of misplaced links, which is used for signed network generation.
      * `propNeg=<PROP_NEG>`: A subfolder for a specific value of proportion of negative links
        * `network=<NETWORK_ID>`: A subfolder for a specific value of network id (for replication pruposes).
          * `<CC_ALGO_NAME>`: A subfolder for a specific partitioning method solving the CC problem. The distinctin of this level is actually useless for now.
        	* `<GRAPH_TYPE>`: A subfolder for a specific network type, e.g. `signed_unweighted`. The distinction of this level is actually useless for now.
* `evaluate-partitions`: Folder containing all results in csv format.
  * `n=<GRAPH_SIZE>_l0=<NB_INIT_MODULES>_dens=<DENSITY>`: A subfolder for specific values of graph size, number of initial modules in the network and density.
    * `propMispl=<PROP_MISPL>`: A subfolder for a specific value of proportion of misplaced links, which is used for signed network generation.
      * `propNeg=<PROP_NEG>`: A subfolder for a specific value of proportion of negative links
		* `<K_DESC>`: This folder is used to distinguish two cases: 1) *All*, 2) `k=<K_VALUE>-<COMP_MEASURE>`. The former exists for the case where the notion of solution classs is not considered. In the latter, the networks are reorganized based on the detected number of solution classes. This is convenient to see and plot the results.
          * `network=<NETWORK_ID>`: A subfolder for a specific value of network id (for replication pruposes).
            * `<CC_ALGO_NAME>`: A subfolder for a specific partitioning method solving the CC problem. The distinctin of this level is actually useless for now.
        	  * `<GRAPH_TYPE>`: A subfolder for a specific network type, e.g. `signed_unweighted`. The distinction of this level is actually useless for now.
    * `detectedImbalance=<IMB_PROP_INTERVAL>`: This folder allows to regroup the networks for a specific interval of detected imbalance (e.g. *0.05-0.1*). This is different from `propMispl`. In other words, this folder does not contain new information compared to `propMispl=<PROP_MISPL>`, it is just a reorganization of results by a different aspect. This is convenient to see and plot the results.
      * `propNeg=<PROP_NEG>`: A subfolder for a specific value of proportion of negative links.
		* `<K_DESC>`: This folder is used to distinguish two cases: 1) *All*, 2) `k=<K_VALUE>-<COMP_MEASURE>`. The former exists for the case where the notion of solution classs is not considered. In the latter, the networks are reorganized based on the detected number of solution classes. This is convenient to see and plot the results.
          * `network=<NETWORK_ID>`: A subfolder for a specific value of network id (for replication pruposes). Note that, network ids might be differant than those in `propMispl=<PROP_MISPL>`. So, they are renumbered.
            * `<CC_ALGO_NAME>`: A subfolder for a specific partitioning method solving the CC problem. The distinctin of this level is actually useless for now.
        	  * `<GRAPH_TYPE>`: A subfolder for a specific network type, e.g. `signed_unweighted`. The distinction of this level is actually useless for now.
* `cluster-analysis`: Folder containing the results related to k-medoids clustering analysis.
  * `n=<GRAPH_SIZE>_l0=<NB_INIT_MODULES>_dens=<DENSITY>`: A subfolder for specific values of graph size, number of initial modules in the network and density.
    * `propMispl=<PROP_MISPL>`: A subfolder for a specific value of proportion of misplaced links, which is used for signed network generation.
      * `propNeg=<PROP_NEG>`: A subfolder for a specific value of proportion of negative links
        * `network=<NETWORK_ID>`: A subfolder for a specific value of network id (for replication pruposes).
          * `<CC_ALGO_NAME>`: A subfolder for a specific partitioning method solving the CC problem. The distinctin of this level is actually useless for now.
        	* `<GRAPH_TYPE>`: A subfolder for a specific network type, e.g. `signed_unweighted`. The distinction of this level is actually useless for now.
        	  * `<COMP_MEASURE>`: A subfolder for a specific value of external comparison measure, e.g. `NMI`
        		* `k=<K_VALUE>-sil=<SILHOUETTE_SCORE>`: A subfolder containing the results of the k-medoids clustering result for a specific value of `k`, where `k` is the desired number of solution classes. 
				  * `clu<SOLUTION_CLASS_ID>`: In this subfolder(s) the partition files related to a given signed network are divided into `k` folders. We create those subfolder(s) only for the value of `k` which is associated with the best silhouette score.
* `cluster-characterization`: Folder containing the results related tocluster characterization process. 1) core part, 2) representative
  * `n=<GRAPH_SIZE>_l0=<NB_INIT_MODULES>_dens=<DENSITY>`: A subfolder for specific values of graph size, number of initial modules in the network and density.
    * `propMispl=<PROP_MISPL>`: A subfolder for a specific value of proportion of misplaced links, which is used for signed network generation.
      * `propNeg=<PROP_NEG>`: A subfolder for a specific value of proportion of negative links
        * `network=<NETWORK_ID>`: A subfolder for a specific value of network id (for replication pruposes).
          * `<CC_ALGO_NAME>`: A subfolder for a specific partitioning method solving the CC problem. The distinctin of this level is actually useless for now.
        	* `<GRAPH_TYPE>`: A subfolder for a specific network type, e.g. `signed_unweighted`. The distinctin of this level is actually useless for now.
        	  * `<COMP_MEASURE>`: A subfolder for a specific value of external comparison measure, e.g. `NMI`
        		* `k=<K_VALUE>-sil=<SILHOUETTE_SCORE>`: A subfolder containing the results of the k-medoids clustering result for a specific value of `k`, where `k` is the desired number of solution classes. Note that Silhouette is not defined for `k=1` and `k=n`.
				  * `core-part=<CORE_PART_THRESHOLD>`: In this subfolder, the core part of each solution class, as well as all the partitions, are shown. Our definition of *core part* depends on `CORE_PART_THRESHOLD`. If this value equals 1, this means that the core part of a solution class consists of being groups of nodes that are always together over all considered partitions. Actually, this value should be always 1 if one wants to have only a single core part structure.
				  * `representative-partitions`: In this subfolder, the optimal partitions that are considered *representative* for each solution class are found. By *representative*, we mean the partition which is most similar to others in the same solution class. Additionnaly, we place in this folder the presentative partition of all the partitions. Note that, even though there are multiple candidates to satisfy our definition of *representative*, we keep only a single one (but this is rare)
* `layout-plots`: The subfolder hierarchy is similar to the previous folders. This folder will contain the plots of type *layout*, i.e. each plot contains several subplots corresponding to an input parameter, and each subplot is divided into multiple parts corresponding to different values of a second input parameter. Therefore, in each plot file, two input parameters are investigated, the other parameters are fixed. Note that we also make distinction of two cnocepts: 1) single network layout plot, and 2) summary network layout plot. In the former, each network is treated separately. Although this is good to plot, what is most interesting is the latter, which corresponds to a combination of all networks under the same input parameter set.
* `output-csv-data`: Some results are recorded in csv format (e.g. number of optimal solutions per network).
